### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Tim Laurijs, born October 6th, 1991 in Arnhem. Graduated as a graphic designer in 2018, Artez, Arnhem. Started crash course at Codaisseur to become a full-stack-developer on June 1st, 2020.  
If you are interestd in my work feel free to checkout the app I made for my fathers [vacation home](https://github.com/timlaurijs/bijlaurijs-client)!

I'm eager to learn new coding skills to better develop my understanding of coding infrastructure and to experiment with the possibilities that come with it.  


*I'm currently looking for a job as a junior developer, please reach out to have a talk and a (virtual) coffee*
